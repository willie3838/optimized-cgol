# Conway's Game of Life (optimized)

## Project Information
This was an attempt to learn C++, fundamentals of Conway's Game of Life (CGOL), and to optimize the code behind it!
To optimize CGOL, I used an unsigned char to store whether or not the cell was alive and the number of alive neighbours it had. 

## Project Showcase

This is how the game looks like with 50% of the board preset.
